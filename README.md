Tech has always had this pull on me — that blend of logic and creativity that keeps you curious. I’m an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineer who loves getting into the nuts and bolts of embedded systems, networking, and the balance between hardware and software.  I spend most of my time working with C, Embedded C, MATLAB, and Linux. Over the years, I’ve built projects around ARM boards, created network-based automation setups, and used MATLAB to model how real signals move and change.  But what really keeps me hooked is building stuff that simply works — practical, efficient, and smart. Sometimes it’s a little firmware tweak; sometimes, it’s a full-blown connected system. Either way, it’s always satisfying to see it come alive.  And I’m always exploring new ideas. New tools, new tech, new ways to make things better. I love sharing what I build through open-source projects that connect hardware and communication in meaningful ways.
